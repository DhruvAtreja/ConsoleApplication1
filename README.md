Steps:
 1: Computation of the digital Gaussian scale-space 
 
 2: Bilinear interpolation of an image
 
 3: Computation of the diï¬€erence of Gaussians scale-space (DoG)
 
 4: Scanning for 3d discrete extrema of the DoG scale-space 
 
 5: Discarding low contrasted candidate keypoints (conservative test) 
 
 6: Keypoints interpolation 
 
 7: Quadratic interpolation on a discrete DoG sample 
 
 8: Discarding low contrasted candidate keypoints 
 
 9: Discarding candidate keypoints on edges 
 
 10: Computation of the 2d gradient at each image of the scale-space 
 
 11: Computing the keypoint reference orientation 
 
 12: Construction of the keypoint descriptor
