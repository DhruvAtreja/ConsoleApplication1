Steps:
 1: Computation of the digital Gaussian scale-space <
 
 
 2: Bilinear interpolation of an image \n
 3: Computation of the diï¬€erence of Gaussians scale-space (DoG) \n
 4: Scanning for 3d discrete extrema of the DoG scale-space \n
 5: Discarding low contrasted candidate keypoints (conservative test) \n 
 6: Keypoints interpolation \n
 7: Quadratic interpolation on a discrete DoG sample \n
 8: Discarding low contrasted candidate keypoints \n
 9: Discarding candidate keypoints on edges \n
 10: Computation of the 2d gradient at each image of the scale-space \n 
 11: Computing the keypoint reference orientation \n
 12: Construction of the keypoint descriptor \n
